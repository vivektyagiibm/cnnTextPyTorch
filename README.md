# CNN Text Classifier PyTorch
A simple one convolution layer + maxpool + full connected  Convolution Text Classifier with word2vec embeddings as input. 
Trained and tested on "Moview Review Dataset". 
Purpose is to teach an interested user on how to train a state of the art CNN text classifier using user-provided emebddings (word2vec in this case). 
A classical SGD is applied to also exemplify the updates in a deep learning system instead of the optimizer method.
